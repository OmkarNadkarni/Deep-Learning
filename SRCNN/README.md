This is a implementation of SRCNN (Image super resolution using deep convolutional networks) using TensorFlow version 1.14.
The implementation is based on this paper https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7115171

The input to the model to the model is a low resolution image and the model outputs a high resolution image. The the model is evaluated by using PSNR value.
